Rounds
======

The following steps explain how to start a round

* Go to http://localhost:8005/admin/round/round/add/ and log in with your superuser
* Chose the amount of people that have to give and receive feedback (called senders and receivers)
* Set the start and end date (people can't give or edit feedback after a round ends)
* Set a description for the specific round
* Select how many roles you want people to give feedback on
* Select how many people you want to give personal feedback to
* Select the amount of minimal feedback to give a user has
* Select a question or add a new one
    * This question will be asked if someone gives feedback to a colleague on a personal level.
* Click on save, go to your newly created round and click the *Start the round* button on the top right to start the round

Personal feedback
=================

We thought of a way that breaks the boring tedious ways of giving feedback to someone on a personal level. A way to do this is to use metaphors, which will help people to think
on a different scale about someone, and will help them think of positives and improvements more easily and more creatively.

Think of questions like:
* If this person was a car, what kind of car would he be?
* If you could think of an animal that would describe this person, which animal would that be?

=============
Role feedback
=============

Role feedback exists of so called 'Ratings'. These ratings are the types of feedback asked about when giving someone feedback on a role.

An example of ratings can be:

* Improvements
* Positives

These ratings get added automatically to a role feedback form. So if you add 25 ratings, the user will be prompted to answer 25 ratings when giving
feedback on a role. We suggest to keep them as simple and descriptive as possible.

You can add ratings by clicking on Feedback in the navigation of the admin and clicking on Ratings.
